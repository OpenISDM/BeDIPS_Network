 * Abstract:
 *
 *      BeDIPS uses LBeacons to deliver 3D coordinates and textual
 *      descriptions of their locations to users' devices. Basically, a
 *      LBeacon is an inexpensive, Bluetooth Smart Ready device. The 3D
 *      coordinates and location description of every LBeacon are retrieved
 *      from BeDIS (Building/environment Data and Information System) and
 *      stored locally during deployment and maintenance times. Once
 *      initialized, each LBeacon broadcasts its coordinates and location
 *      description to Bluetooth enabled user devices within its coverage
 *      area.
